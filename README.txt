Repository for code and data for interferometric SIM
****************************************************

This is the master branch for the MAI-SIM repository
associated with publication. This current branch is
static and any future devleopments (aside from major
bug fixes) will take place in the development branch. 
This code has been test on Windows 10 using Python
3.9, MATLAB R2021a and Pytorch version  1.10.1-
py3.9_cuda11.3_cudnn8_0. Evaluation of the ML-SIM
network was completed on an Nvidia 3060 GPU.

Installation
****************************************************

Once the dependnacies are installed, no special 
installation is required and code will run as-is.
